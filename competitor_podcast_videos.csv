Studies show we spend up to 70% of our mental energy focusing on things we can't control, which affects our relationships, stress levels and health. But what if there were two simple words that could help us all break free?

Today's returning guest is Mel Robbins. Mel is a former lawyer and someone who has now become a sought-after expert in life improvement, mindset, and behaviour change. The occasion for her second appearance on my podcast is the launch of her latest book, #1 New York Times best-seller The Let Them Theory: A Life-Changing Tool That Millions of People Can‚Äôt Stop Talking About.

In this episode, you'll learn about:
‚Ä¢ The 'Let Them Theory' mindset tool - understand the two simple but profound parts: ""Let them"" for accepting what you can't control, and ""Let me"" for focusing on what you can
‚Ä¢ The 5 questions that Mel thinks we should be asking ourselves
‚Ä¢ The truth about failure - discover why the fear of failing isn't about failure itself, but about others' opinions
‚Ä¢ Breaking free from people-pleasing - learn why we struggle to ask for what we need and how to start prioritising ourselves
‚Ä¢ Emotional maturity - understand why adults often behave like ""8-year-olds in big bodies"" when emotional, and how to develop greater emotional intelligence
‚Ä¢ The health-stress connection - explore how being triggered by others' actions leads to unhealthy coping mechanisms, and how to break free from this cycle
‚Ä¢ Relationship wisdom - discover why criticism and disappointment are normal, and how accepting people as they are improves relationships

Over the past few years, Mel has amassed an incredible 25 million followers online because of her unique ability to connect with others.  She is passionate, articulate and very relatable - and this conversation is full of practical tools to help you transform your relationships, lower your stress, increase your energy and feel more in control of life.

Do you think that it‚Äôs inevitable that the function of your brain will decline as you get older? Or, do you believe that there are simple things you can do each day to preserve, protect and enhance it?

Today‚Äôs guest is neurophysiologist and brain health researcher, Louisa Nicola. Louisa is founder of Neuro Athletics, where she works with high-performing individuals to optimise their cognitive function. Nine years ago, Louisa was training to go to the Olympics to represent Australia in the triathlon when she was hit by a car and suffered seemingly insurmountable injuries. 

Desperate to accelerate her recovery, she integrated brain training into her approach to physical health and made a near-miraculous recovery. Since then, she has helped many elite performers perform better, think faster and live longer by leveraging neuroscience, exercise physiology, sleep science and nutrition.

In this conversation, we discuss:
‚Ä¢ How our brain works as an intricate network - with 87 billion neurons making approximately 5000 connections each
‚Ä¢ The latest research about Alzheimer's disease, including why it affects more women than men.
‚Ä¢ Why a combination of regular aerobic exercise, high-intensity training, and resistance sessions can help protect brain function
‚Ä¢ The importance of consistent, quality sleep to support your brain's natural cleaning processes
‚Ä¢ And, how supplements like creatine monohydrate and omega-3 fatty acids can support brain health, alongside the right nutrition.

One of the key themes in this conversation is that our daily habits compound over time to either protect or compromise the health of our brains - and, throughout, Louisa shares a variety of practical strategies we can all adopt - suitable for every age and fitness level.

Louisa‚Äôs message is both urgent and hopeful: while our modern lifestyles may be contributing to rising rates of cognitive decline, we have more control over our brain health than we might think.

Why has nutrition - something that should be so simple - become so complicated? With 70% of our diet now consisting of ultra-processed foods and conflicting advice everywhere we look, is it any wonder we're confused about what to eat?

Today's returning guest is my good friend, Dr Rupy Aujla, who is on a mission to make healthy cooking accessible and enjoyable for all. He‚Äôs a medical doctor, nutritionist and founder of The Doctor's Kitchen and author of five best-selling books.

If you haven't heard Rupy's story before, his life was changed after suffering a significant heart condition in 2009. After learning about nutritional medicine, he was able to reverse his condition using a food and lifestyle approach. Today, Rupy is constantly creating tasty recipes that help people optimise their health and he shares them - yes, in his cookbooks - but, also, in his wonderful Doctor‚Äôs Kitchen recipe app that helps over 10,000 people each week use evidence-based food and lifestyle medicine, to live healthier, happier lives. 

In this fantastic conversation, you'll discover:
‚Ä¢ The science of burning fat and why calorie counting often fails in the real world 
‚Ä¢ Four evidence-based principles for sustainable weight management that don't require strict tracking 
‚Ä¢ Why ultra-processed foods lead to overconsumption and how to naturally reduce them in your diet
‚Ä¢ The power of single-ingredient foods and how they can transform your health - and why protein at breakfast is crucial for appetite regulation throughout the day
‚Ä¢ Why eating dinner a little bit earlier, can significantly impact our metabolism and weight
‚Ä¢ How the quality of our sleep directly affects our food choices and the connection between emotional eating and our relationship with food
‚Ä¢ Why different diets work for different people, how to find your personal approach and practical tips for implementing healthy changes while maintaining a busy lifestyle

This conversation strips away the complexity of nutrition, offering clear, actionable strategies that anyone can implement. 

So, if you're feeling overwhelmed by conflicting nutrition advice, this conversation offers a practical roadmap forward, showing you how simple - and enjoyable - healthy eating can be.

‚Ä¢ How to build meaningful relationships - including the concept of ‚Äòdarkest hour friends‚Äô and why authentic connections are crucial for wellbeing
‚Ä¢ The truth about external validation and Sahil's journey from chasing financial success to finding genuine fulfilment

Why do we find it so hard to exercise despite knowing how good it is for us? Is sitting really the new smoking? And what can we learn about movement from studying populations who live more traditional lifestyles?

My guest today is the brilliant Daniel Lieberman, Professor of Biological Science and Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. His research studies how and why the human body is the way that it is, focusing on the evolution of physical activities such as walking and running and their relevance to health and disease. He has published more than 200 peer-reviewed papers and three books, including his most recent, Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved To Do is Healthy and Rewarding.

In this conversation, we cover so many fascinating topics and explore the powerful idea that humans have not actually evolved to exercise.

We compare the sitting habits of modern humans with more traditional societies and Daniel shares why it may not be how long we sit for that is causing us problems, but more the way in which we choose to sit. We also talk about the profound importance of maintaining strength and activity as we age, the relationship between movement and cancer, the truth about barefoot running and minimalist shoes and the concept of 'mismatch diseases' - this idea that our modern environment is in direct conflict with our evolutionary design, and the impact this is having on our wellbeing.

Throughout the conversation, Daniel challenges many common beliefs that exist around health, and offers us evidence-based, practical strategies for building a healthier relationship with physical activity. 

Whether you're interested in the science of movement, looking to build sustainable exercise habits into your life, or simply curious about how our ancestors lived, this is a truly wonderful conversation with one of the world‚Äôs most highly respected experts. I hope you enjoy listening.

When you think about improving your health, do you ever think about the health of your mouth? If you heard last week‚Äôs episode with Dr Emily Leeming, you will know just how important your gut microbiome is, for many aspects of your health, but did you know that your mouth also has its own microbiome, and the health of it is just as important?

Today‚Äôs guest is Dr Victoria Sampson, a functional dentist and researcher based in central London, whose work has been recognised all over the world, resulting in her becoming a scientific advisor and clinical lead to several international dental companies, as well as a topical team member of the European Space Agency and NASA. She has published numerous scientific papers, was the first dentist in the world to link gum disease with worse COVID complications. She also recently launched her own oral microbiome test, Oralis 1, which assesses the saliva for bacteria, inflammatory markers, and genetic mutations. 

In this fascinating conversation, Victoria reveals why we must stop treating the mouth as separate from the rest of the body and explains how the oral microbiome - home to 700 different species of bacteria - influences everything from our blood sugar control to the health of our hearts. 

She also shares compelling research showing how treating gum disease can improve our blood sugar levels, why men with poor oral health are nearly three times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction, the relationship between the oral microbiome and autoimmune disease, the surprising link between oral health and fertility and so much more.

Throughout the conversation, Victoria shares practical tips that we can all use immediately to improve our short-term and our long-term health. 

Whether you're dealing with persistent dental problems despite good hygiene, managing a chronic health condition, or simply want to optimise your wellbeing, this conversation offers a powerful reminder that the path to better health might just start in your mouth. I hope you enjoy listening.

Twenty years ago, very few scientists even knew about something called the gut microbiome. Now, with over 70,000 research papers published on the subject, this complex ecosystem, home to trillions of microorganisms, is recognised as a key factor in our physical and mental wellbeing.

Today's guest is Dr Emily Leeming, microbiome scientist and researcher at King‚Äôs College London, registered dietitian, former chef, and author of Genius Gut: The Life-Changing Science of Eating for your Second Brain‚Äô.

In this conversation, Emily explains how our understanding of gut health has evolved dramatically over the past two decades, to the point where we now know it plays a crucial role in everything from our immune system, our ability to respond to stress, our skin and even our mental wellbeing.

But, how can we assess the state of our own gut health? Emily shares how observing your own bowel movements can often tell you more about your gut health than costly microbiome tests and why some bloating after meals may actually be a sign of a healthy gut.

We also discuss how our gut health has been negatively impacted by our modern lifestyles - stress, sleep quality, our modern diets as well as the timing of our meals. And, Emily shares why time-restricted eating and earlier dinner times can be really beneficial.

Finally, Emily also gives some really practical advice about what we can eat to improve the state of our gut health, and explains why breakfast offers us a golden opportunity to support our gut health and why she is not a fan of recommending that everyone eat 30 different plant foods each week.

Emily is someone who is highly knowledgeable and passionate about helping us all improve the health of our guts. Her message is clear: nurturing our gut microbiome is not about following rigid rules - it's about understanding this remarkable ecosystem and working with it, not against it. I hope you enjoy listening.

From multiple arrests in her early twenties to building a multi-hundred-million-dollar business empire, Leila Hormozi's journey reveals how mastering emotional regulation became the cornerstone of her success. In this deeply vulnerable conversation, Leila opens up about overcoming childhood trauma, battling anxiety, and learning to embrace discomfort as a pathway to growth. What sets her apart isn't just her business acumen, but her radical approach to managing negative thoughts and emotions ‚Äì accepting them as natural companions on the path to excellence rather than obstacles to overcome. Through raw stories and tactical insights, she demonstrates how true leadership isn't about eliminating fear or self-doubt, but about taking successful actions despite them. This episode is especially valuable for entrepreneurs, leaders, and anyone struggling to navigate their emotional landscape while pursuing ambitious goals.

Each week, you‚Äôll receive powerful tools and ideas to elevate your mind and redesign your life - https://start.mindvalley.com/EHYqZX3A 

In this powerful clip, we explore the true meaning of presence through an inspiring story about the Dalai Lama. At the end of a five-day event, he took the time to say goodbye to each member of the hotel staff‚Äîconnecting deeply with everyone from the CEO to the waitstaff. 

The Dalai Lama's ability to be fully present with each person demonstrates a profound lesson on human connection: seeing and honoring the person in front of you as the most important in that moment.

Learn how this awareness shapes deeper relationships, the challenges of connecting when our inner ""parts"" seek fulfillment, and how practices like Internal Family Systems (IFS) can help us heal and connect authentically.
